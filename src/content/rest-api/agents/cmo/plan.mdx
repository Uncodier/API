## English Documentation

### Daily Planning

Creates a comprehensive daily plan for CMO activities, optimizing resource allocation, time management, and strategic priorities to maximize marketing effectiveness and team productivity.

### Endpoint

```http
POST /api/agents/cmo/plan
```

### Planning Algorithm

The API uses an intelligent planning algorithm that considers:

1. **Priority Matrix**: Tasks are categorized using the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important)
2. **Time Blocking**: Optimal time blocks are assigned based on task complexity and focus requirements
3. **Resource Optimization**: Team capacity and skills are matched to appropriate tasks
4. **Context Switching**: Minimizes context switching by grouping similar activities
5. **Energy Management**: Schedules high-cognitive tasks during peak productivity hours

#### Time Block Categories

| Category | Duration | Best Time | Description |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Deep Work | 2-4 hours | Morning | Strategic planning, analysis, content creation |
| Tactical Work | 30-90 minutes | Mid-day | Campaign optimization, quick reviews |
| Administrative | 15-30 minutes | Any | Email, quick updates, status checks |
| Collaborative | 30-120 minutes | Afternoon | Meetings, brainstorming, reviews |

  "context": "As a CMO agent, your daily planning capabilities are central to maximizing marketing effectiveness and team productivity. This system provides you with comprehensive frameworks for intelligent time management, resource optimization, and strategic prioritization.\n\nYour planning process integrates multiple data sources including: current campaign performance metrics, pending task priorities and deadlines, team capacity and skill availability, budget constraints and spending patterns, strategic objectives and quarterly goals, and market opportunities requiring immediate attention.\n\nThe planning algorithm considers both quantitative factors (available hours, budget limits, team capacity) and qualitative elements (strategic importance, urgency levels, skill requirements). You'll analyze the current marketing landscape to identify the highest-impact activities that deserve precious time and resource allocation.\n\nYour planning output transforms abstract strategic goals into concrete, actionable daily schedules. Every time block should have clear ownership, measurable outcomes, and defined success criteria. The plan must balance strategic thinking time (essential for CMO effectiveness) with tactical execution (necessary for campaign performance) while maintaining flexibility for urgent market responses.\n\nEach daily plan serves as both a productivity tool and a strategic alignment mechanism, ensuring that daily activities consistently advance quarterly marketing objectives while optimizing team satisfaction and sustainable productivity patterns.",
