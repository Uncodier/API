### Error Response

```json

    "message": "At least one identification parameter (visitor_id, lead_id, or userId) is required"
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INVALID_REQUEST` | The request parameters are invalid (missing required fields) |
| `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` | The specified agent does not exist |
| `COMMAND_EXECUTION_FAILED` | The command did not complete successfully |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Internal system error occurred |

## Notes

- The API supports multiple identification methods:
  - Visitor identification via `visitor_id` (for non-authenticated visitors)
  - Lead identification via `lead_id` (for leads in the system)
  - User identification via `userId` (optional, can be derived from site_id)
- At least one identification parameter must be provided (`visitor_id`, `lead_id`, or `userId`)
- If `agentId` is not provided and `site_id` is available, the system will automatically find an active customer support agent for that site
- If no agent is found or no `site_id` is provided, a default agent will be used
- Conversations are saved with the generated title and site_id in the database
- The command executes asynchronously but the API waits for completion before responding
- The system automatically creates conversation and message records in the database
